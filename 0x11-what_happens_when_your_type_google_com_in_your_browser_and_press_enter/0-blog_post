What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

When you type a URL like https://www.google.com into your browser and hit Enter, a series of operations occur to provide the webpage you requested. Let’s break down each stage.

1. DNS Request
The DNS (Domain Name System) translates the human-readable domain name into an IP address.

Cache Check: The browser first checks its cache and the OS cache for the IP address of www.google.com. If not found, it queries the local DNS resolver provided by your ISP.
Recursive Query: If the local resolver lacks the information, it performs a recursive query, starting with root DNS servers, moving to TLD servers (e.g., .com), and finally reaching the authoritative DNS server for google.com.
Response: The authoritative server returns the IP address of Google’s server, which is cached for future requests.

2. TCP/IP
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) sends data over the internet.

Three-Way Handshake:
SYN: The browser sends a SYN packet to the server.
SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet.
ACK: The browser sends an ACK packet, establishing the connection.

3. Firewall
Firewalls monitor and control network traffic based on security rules.

Inspection: During the TCP handshake, firewalls inspect packets to ensure compliance with security policies.
Pass or Block: If the packets pass inspection, the connection proceeds; otherwise, it is blocked.
4. HTTPS/SSL
HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) uses SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) for secure communication.

SSL Handshake:
ClientHello: The browser sends a ClientHello message with supported SSL/TLS versions and cipher suites.
ServerHello: The server responds with a ServerHello message.
Certificate Exchange: The server sends its SSL certificate to the browser.
Key Exchange: Both parties exchange keys to create a session key for encryption.
Secure Connection: Subsequent data is encrypted and secure.

5. Load-Balancer
Load-balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource use and ensure availability.

Traffic Distribution: The load balancer decides which server will handle the request based on algorithms like round-robin or least connections.
Forwarding: It forwards the request to the selected server.

6. Web Server
The Web Server handles HTTP requests and serves static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Request Handling: The server receives and processes the request for https://www.google.com.
Static Content: If the request is for static content, the web server retrieves and sends the files back to the browser.

7. Application Server
The Application Server executes dynamic content and business logic.

Dynamic Content: For dynamic content requests, the web server forwards the request to the application server.
Processing: The application server processes the request, runs server-side scripts, and generates the necessary content.

8. Database
The Database stores and retrieves data required by the application.

Query Execution: The application server queries the database for information.
Data Retrieval: The database returns the requested data to the application server.
Response Generation: The application server uses the data to generate a response.

Conclusion
After these steps, the generated content is sent back through the layers: from the application server to the web server, via the load balancer, encrypted via HTTPS, passing the firewall, transmitted via TCP/IP, and finally displayed in your browser. This entire process happens in a fraction of a second, providing a seamless browsing experience.
